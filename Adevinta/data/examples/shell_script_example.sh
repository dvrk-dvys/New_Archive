#Sure! Shell scripts and YAML configurations are crucial for automating various tasks and managing configurations in a tech ecosystem that involves data pipelines, ETL processes, and infrastructure management. Here are examples of different types of shell scripts that would be useful in such a tech ecosystem:

### 1. Data Ingestion Script
#Frequency: Hourly or Daily
#A script to automate data ingestion from an external source into an S3 bucket.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
SOURCE_URL="https://example.com/data.csv"
DEST_BUCKET="s3://my-data-bucket/raw-data/"

# Download the data
wget $SOURCE_URL -O /tmp/data.csv

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp /tmp/data.csv $DEST_BUCKET

# Clean up
rm /tmp/data.csv

echo "Data ingestion completed successfully."
```

### 2. Spark Job Submission Script

#A script to submit a Spark job to process data.
#Frequency: Daily or On-Demand

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
SPARK_MASTER="spark://spark-master:7077"
SPARK_APP_JAR="/path/to/my-spark-app.jar"
SPARK_APP_MAIN_CLASS="com.example.MySparkApp"
INPUT_PATH="s3://my-data-bucket/raw-data/data.csv"
OUTPUT_PATH="s3://my-data-bucket/processed-data/"

# Submit Spark job
spark-submit \
  --master $SPARK_MASTER \
  --class $SPARK_APP_MAIN_CLASS \
  $SPARK_APP_JAR \
  --input $INPUT_PATH \
  --output $OUTPUT_PATH

echo "Spark job submitted successfully."
```

### 3. Kafka Topic Creation Script

#A script to create a Kafka topic for streaming data.
#Frequency: On-Demand

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
KAFKA_BROKER="localhost:9092"
TOPIC_NAME="my-topic"
PARTITIONS=3
REPLICATION_FACTOR=1

# Create Kafka topic
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --bootstrap-server $KAFKA_BROKER \
  --replication-factor $REPLICATION_FACTOR \
  --partitions $PARTITIONS \
  --topic $TOPIC_NAME

echo "Kafka topic '$TOPIC_NAME' created successfully."
```

### 4. Database Backup Script

#A script to backup a PostgreSQL database and upload it to S3.
#Frequency: Daily
 #
 #Reason: Regular backups are critical for data recovery and compliance purposes.
 # Daily backups ensure that data can be restored to the previous day's state in case of any data loss or corruption.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
DB_NAME="mydatabase"
DB_USER="myuser"
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_PORT="5432"
S3_BUCKET="s3://my-backup-bucket/"
BACKUP_FILE="/tmp/${DB_NAME}_$(date +%F).sql"

# Backup the database
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -U $DB_USER -F c -b -v -f $BACKUP_FILE $DB_NAME

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp $BACKUP_FILE $S3_BUCKET

# Clean up
rm $BACKUP_FILE

echo "Database backup completed successfully."
```

### 5. YAML Configuration for Airflow DAG

#An example YAML configuration file for setting up an Airflow connection.
#Frequency: On-Demand
 #
 #Reason: YAML configuration changes are typically made during setup or when there are changes to the workflow or infrastructure.
 # These changes are applied as needed.

```yaml
airflow:
  connections:
    - id: my_s3_conn
      conn_type: S3
      extra: '{"aws_access_key_id": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", "aws_secret_access_key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"}'
```

### 6. Deployment Script

#A script to deploy an application using Docker and Kubernetes.
#Frequency: On-Demand or During Scheduled Releases

#Reason: Deployment scripts are run during application releases, updates, or hotfixes.
# This can be part of a scheduled release cycle (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly) or on-demand for urgent changes.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
DOCKER_IMAGE="my-app:latest"
KUBE_NAMESPACE="default"
KUBE_DEPLOYMENT="my-app-deployment"
KUBE_SERVICE="my-app-service"

# Build Docker image
docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE .

# Push Docker image to registry
docker push $DOCKER_IMAGE

# Update Kubernetes deployment
kubectl set image deployment/$KUBE_DEPLOYMENT my-app-container=$DOCKER_IMAGE --namespace=$KUBE_NAMESPACE

# Restart Kubernetes service
kubectl rollout restart deployment/$KUBE_DEPLOYMENT --namespace=$KUBE_NAMESPACE

echo "Application deployed successfully."
```

### 7. Monitoring Script

#A script to monitor a web service and send an alert if it is down.
#Frequency: Every Few Minutes
 #
 #Reason: Monitoring scripts need to run frequently to ensure that services are continuously monitored and any issues are detected promptly.
 # Running every few minutes ensures timely alerts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
URL="https://example.com/health"
ALERT_EMAIL="alert@example.com"

# Check service health
STATUS_CODE=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" $URL)

if [ $STATUS_CODE -ne 200 ]; then
  echo "Service is down. Sending alert..."
  echo "Service at $URL is down. Status code: $STATUS_CODE" | mail -s "Service Down Alert" $ALERT_EMAIL
else
  echo "Service is up. Status code: $STATUS_CODE"
fi
```

### Summary

#These shell scripts and YAML configuration examples cover various aspects of managing
# and automating tasks in a tech ecosystem involving data pipelines, ETL processes,
# and infrastructure management. Each script is designed to handle specific tasks such
# as data ingestion, job submission, Kafka topic creation, database backup, deployment,
# and monitoring, providing a foundation for building more complex automation workflows.
