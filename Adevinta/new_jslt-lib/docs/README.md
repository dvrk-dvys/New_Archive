# JSLT-lib

Community driven library for [JSLT](https://github.com/schibsted/jslt). It allows users to easily contribute and compose higher-level functionality by reusing existing pieces. 

While JSLT-lib is a general purpose library, for the moment its development is highly focused on supporting Data Quality Checks. In the future other purposes may be included in the library (transforms, filters, etc).

## Testing

Functions implemented in the library are individually tested. Tests are based on [JSLT-test](https://docs.mpi-internal.com/yotta/jslt-test/)
